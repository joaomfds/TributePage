                <li>
                  <strong>1892</strong> Tesla discovers X-ray radiation while experimenting with HV and evacuated tubes.
                  This is THREE YEARS before they are rediscovered by Willhelm Roentgen. Tesla terms the effect "radiant
                  energy"€ of an invisible kind. Tesla actually warns of potential hazards of these rays during a lecture
                  before the New York Academy of Sciences in 1897. ("The stream of Lenard and Roentgen and novel apparatus
                  for their production")</li>

                <li>
                  <strong>1907</strong> During the financial panic of 1907, Tesla agrees to release Westinghouse from paying
                  royalties on every induction motor. Weakened by the "War of the Currents", Westinghouse convinces Tesla
                  to sell his royalty rights to Westinghouse for $216,000 - they were worth over $12 Million at the time.
                  The Westinghouse Company survives the crisis...</li>
